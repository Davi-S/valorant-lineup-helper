## About The Project

In Valorant, the points on the map that you memorize to make lineups are all angle based. So, if you learn how to angle your throwables, you'll be able to do lineups from anywhere with almost any agent - agents have similar throwables, like Viper smoke and Killjoy nanoswarm; a line up for Viper work perfectly with Killjoy -.

This program just helps you find the angles and their respective distances for the projects.

This is ban free. I do not modify the game or read data.

## Getting Started

run the main file

## Usage

When executing the main file, the terminal will open. You can close the program by closing the terminal, as the program does not have a close button to not take space on the screen.

Three buttons will aper on the left side of the screen:

-first button: show or hide the marks.

-second button: Alternate through long range or medium range projectiles. Viper poison and Sage slow, for example are long ranged; and Viper smoke and Killjoy are medium raged.

-third button: Alternate between stopped, running, or jumping when throwing.
