## About The Project

In Valorant, the points on the map that you memorize to make lineups are all angle-based. So, if you learn how to angle your throwables, you'll be able to do lineups from anywhere with almost any agent

This program just helps you find the angles and their respective distances for the projectiles.

This is ban-free. It does not modify the game or read data.

When you run the exe, a terminal will open. You can close the terminal to close the program.

## Usage

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk4y5L4_kxs) Explains how the "sky-dot" method works. [This other video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfkvQpB-sJs) is a showcase of this lineup helper program

There are three buttons on the left side of the screen:

- First button: shows or hides the distance marks.

- Second button: Alternate through "long-range" or "medium-range" projectiles. For example: Viper poison and Sage slow are long-range projectiles, and Viper smoke and Killjoy nanobots are medium-range projectiles.

- Third button: Alternate between stopping, running, or jumping when throwing. If you set it to "still" you must be stopped to throw; if you set it to "jump", you must jump when throwing; if you set do "run" you have to be running when throwing.
